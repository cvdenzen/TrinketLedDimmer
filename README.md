Dual Led dimmer with button control

This project is about a dual led dimmer. I use the dimmer in a converted dual halogen (250W+35W) lamp.
Originally this lamp is controlled by two buttons, one for each lamp.
I want to re-use these buttons and to replace the (energy-unfriendly) halogen bulbs by led strips.

The schema files are made with KiCad.
